# Parking simulator 
## Academy'18 • 2nd stage • 2. C# Modern Features

This project was created on .NET Core, because I use Mac OS. Code is multi-platform and work on other platforms as fine as on Mac OS. When I was writting this console app, I tried to make it interesting for reading and easy for extensibility. To tell the truth, I've used many patterns and approaches in my Simulator. Not really to make it complex, but make full of interesting code :) Good structured, constructed and working code is better than any book (Yea, sometimes I read another's code, when I have nothing to do)

## Quick start
### Mac Os

1. Install [XCode Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
2. Install [Visual Studio For Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/mac/?rr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)
3. When you've opened solution just build and enjoy :)
